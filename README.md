# hello-world
My first repo on GitHub
I love how coding pushes me out of my comfort zone.  How it makes me focus, structure, more than I ever possible could.  I want to be very good at this, but it will take time.  I must be patient, disciplined, and focused.  I will treat this like music.  I need to find a SANGHA.
